    "## Advice on Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "nbmake is best used in a scenario where you use the ipynb files only for development. Consumption of notebooks is primarily done via a docs site, built through jupyter book, nbsphinx, or some other means. If using one of these tools, you are able to write assertion code in cells which will be [hidden from readers](https://jupyterbook.org/interactive/hiding.html).\n",

    "### Pre-commit\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating notebooks like source files lets you keep your repo minimal. Some tools, such as plotly may drop several megabytes of javascript in your output cells, as a result, stripping out notebooks on pre-commit is advisable:\n",

    "```\n",
